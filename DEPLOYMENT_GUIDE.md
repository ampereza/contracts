# 🚀 Deploy Flash Loan Contract to Arbitrum & View on Explorer

## 📋 Prerequisites

### 1. Get an Arbiscan API Key
- Visit https://arbiscan.io/apis
- Create an account and generate an API key
- This is needed for contract verification

### 2. Prepare Your Wallet
- Ensure you have ETH on Arbitrum for gas fees
- Export your private key from MetaMask/wallet

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual values
nano .env
```

Add your credentials to `.env`:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix
ARBISCAN_API_KEY=your_arbiscan_api_key
```

## 🚀 Deploy to Arbitrum Mainnet

### Step 1: Deploy the Contract
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simple.js --network arbitrum
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Deploying AaveV3FlashLoan contract...
Network: arbitrum
Deploying with account: 0x1234...5678
Account balance: 0.1 ETH
Transaction Hash: 0xabc123...def456

✅ Deployment Complete!
Contract Address: 0x9876...5432
🔍 View on Arbitrum Explorer:
Contract: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9876...5432
Transaction: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xabc123...def456
```

### Step 2: Execute a Flash Loan
```bash
# First, update the contract address in the script
nano scripts/execute-flashloan.js

# Update this line:
const FLASH_LOAN_CONTRACT = "0x9876...5432"; // Your deployed address

# Then execute:
npx hardhat run scripts/execute-flashloan.js --network arbitrum
```

## 🔍 What You'll See on Arbiscan

### 1. Contract Deployment Transaction
- **Link**: `https://arbiscan.io/tx/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_TX_HASH`
- **Details**: Contract creation, gas used, ETH cost
- **Status**: Success ✅

### 2. Deployed Contract Page
- **Link**: `https://arbiscan.io/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Contract verification (source code visible)
  - 📊 Transaction history
  - 🔧 Read/Write contract functions
  - 📈 Analytics and events

### 3. Flash Loan Transaction
- **Link**: `https://arbiscan.io/tx/YOUR_FLASHLOAN_TX_HASH`
- **Internal Transactions**: 
  - 💰 DAI borrowed from Aave
  - 🔄 Your contract logic executed
  - 💸 DAI + fee returned to Aave
- **Events Emitted**:
  - `FlashLoanExecuted` from your contract
  - `FlashLoan` from Aave pool

## 📊 Real Explorer Examples

After deployment, you can:

1. **View Contract Source**: Verified contract with full Solidity code
2. **Monitor Transactions**: Every flash loan execution visible
3. **Track Events**: Flash loan events and custom logs
4. **Analyze Gas**: Optimization opportunities
5. **Check Balances**: Real-time contract state

## 🔧 Verification Process

The deployment script automatically verifies your contract:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network arbitrum YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "0xa97684ead0e402dC232d5A977953DF7ECBaB3CDb"
```

## 💡 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test locally first (free)
npx hardhat test

# Test with Arbitrum fork (free)
npx hardhat test test/AaveV3FlashLoan.integration.test.js

# Deploy to Arbitrum (costs ETH)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simple.js --network arbitrum

# Execute flash loan (costs ETH + fees)
npx hardhat run scripts/execute-flashloan.js --network arbitrum
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Gas Costs**: Deployment ~$2-5, Flash loan execution ~$0.50-2
2. **Flash Loan Fees**: Aave charges 0.05% (0.5 DAI per 1000 DAI borrowed)
3. **Security**: Never commit `.env` file to git
4. **Testing**: Always test on fork before mainnet

## 🎯 Next Steps

After seeing your transactions on Arbiscan:
1. Implement your arbitrage/trading logic
2. Add multi-asset flash loan support
3. Optimize gas usage
4. Build monitoring tools
5. Scale your DeFi operations

Your flash loan transactions will be publicly visible and verifiable on Arbiscan! 🎉
